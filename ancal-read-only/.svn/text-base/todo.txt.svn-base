- lock running in portrait mode
  <activity android:screenOrientation="portrait" 

- doesn't show "day ? of year".

- doesn't honour system-wide date format.
  In Settings, the date format is YYYY-MM-DD, but in AnCal, it's still DD-MM-YYYY.
	
- no compress view in day view. (e.g. Remove idle hours to save screen space.)

- cannot configure default time range shown in day view, always 6am to 10pm.

- iCal syncing

- location field for an appointment

- searching with
  android.app.SearchManager
					
- autoscroll DAY View to current hour
